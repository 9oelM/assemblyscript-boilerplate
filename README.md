# Assemblyscript-boilerplate
- [x] node in typescript
- [x] testing in as-pect
- [x] automation via gulp

## Usage
Oftentimes, it's frustrating to compile every single time assemblyscript and typescript files and run them over and over. This simple repository sets things up so that files can be watched and run upon any changes.

Compile assemblyscript and typescript files, run node on the entry point, and watch for changes:

```
npm run gulp
```

Run tests using as-pect

```
npm test
```
